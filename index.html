        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Between 24.06.2019-12.07.2019, I did a volunteer internship at
          EKSPROMA company. I learned intermediate level C++ and Microsoft
          office at my school. I did internship on software development at Pyz
          Realizing Design Studio in October 2021. During my working time, I
          learned React native, Android studio, JavaScript, Html, Css languages.
          In June 2022, I had a 3-month compulsory internship experience in the
          electrical maintenance workshop of the Kütahya Ceramic Factory. In
          this experience, I dealt with electrical panel malfunctions and
          learned about the devices used. I experienced teamwork and
          master-apprentice relationship. I was involved in PLC projects. My
          foreign language level is intermediate.
